# Simple Self-learning AI

*Ana* is a simple side-project AI. It can solve TicTacToe, isn't good at it though üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Featuring:

* **Questionable Decisions**: Ana knows very well what its doing, you just don't understand. Yet.
* **Continuous Improvement**: Like any real being, Ana is focused on improving its skills day by day, writing down notes, and learning on mistakes.
* **Better-than-Chrome performance**: Works on a single thread so far. Sorry.

## How to run

Ana requires `npm` to run. Also `typescript` and `node`, but that is included in the package. Just take care of `npm` please. Then:

* `git clone https://github.com/mjurczyk/ana`
* `npm i`
* `npm start`

At this moment Ana features only the TicTacToe module. Can, and certainly should, be extended with some visual module, keyboard controls, and [Dark Souls](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/dark-souls-iii-review/) drivers.

## GDPR

Ana doesn't store your data and won't ask for your email. Really.
